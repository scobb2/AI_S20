If it's doing real-time data augmentation, why is that an issue? 
Every time you call the fit it is creating new batches of images 
using the ImageDataGenerator, which is doing random transformations 
to each image based on ranges of values given to it. Newly 
augmented--unique--images would be being used to train the model.




In file Analysis.txt give a short description of the hyperparameters you tried, 
and the outcomes you saw, including the hyperparameter set you decided on, 
including channels per convo layer and any regularization or dropout. Discuss 
the data augmentation you used. Include also the final accuracy obtained in
